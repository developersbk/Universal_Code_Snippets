/*This C++ program displays the solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem using the base-2 representation of the move number with the following rules:-
There is one binary digit (bit) for each disk.
The most significant (leftmost) bit represents the largest disk. A value of 0 indicates that the largest disk is on the initial peg, while a 1 indicates that itâ€™s on the final peg.
The bitstring is read from left to right, and each bit can be used to determine the location of the corresponding disk.
A bit with the same value as the previous one means that the corresponding disk is stacked on top the previous disk on the same peg.
A bit with a different value to the previous one means that the corresponding disk is one position to the left or right of the previous one.*/
