/*This is a C++ Program to implement Gift Wrapping algorithm to find convex hull in two dimensional space. In computational geometry, the gift wrapping algorithm is an algorithm for computing the convex hull of a given set of points. In the two-dimensional case the algorithm is also known as Jarvis march, after R. A. Jarvis, who published it in 1973; it has O(nh) time complexity, where n is the number of points and h is the number of points on the convex hull. Its real-life performance compared with other convex hull algorithms is favorable when n is small or h is expected to be very small with respect to n. In general cases the algorithm is outperformed by many others.*/
