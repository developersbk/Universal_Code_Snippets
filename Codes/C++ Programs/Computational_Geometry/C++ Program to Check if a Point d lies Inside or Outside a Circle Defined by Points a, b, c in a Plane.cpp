/*This is a C++ Program to Check if a Point d lies Inside or Outside a Circle Defined by Points a, b, c in a Plane. For any point t (xt, yt) on the plane, its position with respect to the circle defined by 3 points (x1, y1) , (x2, y2), (x3, y3).
s = (x-xt)^2 + (y-yt)^2 â€“ r*r
If s < 0, t lies inside the circle; if s > 0, t lies outside the circle; if s = 0, t lies on the circle.*/
