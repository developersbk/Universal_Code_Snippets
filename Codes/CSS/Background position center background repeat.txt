  <p>Outside are the storms and strangers:
     We - Oh, close, safe and warm sleep I and she, I and she . . .
     Robert Browning</p>

  <p>Clarity of mind means clarity of passion, too;
     this is why a great and clear mind loves ardently
     and sees distinctly what it loves.
     Blaise Pascal</p>

  <p>A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.
     Thomas Carlyle</p>

  <p>Take away love, and our earth is a tomb.
     Robert Browning</p>

  <p>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
     My love as deep;
     The more I give to thee
     The more I have,
     For both are infinite.
     William Shakespeare</p>

  <p>Love is always open arms.
     If you close your arms about love,
     you will find that you are left holding only yourself.
     Leo Buscaglia</p>

  <p>My heart to you is given:
     Oh, do give yours to me;
     We'll lock them up together,
     And throw away the key.
     Frederick Saunders</p>
