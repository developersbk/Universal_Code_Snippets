    <h1>Love Love Love</h1>
    <p>In any relationship in which two people become one, the end result is two half people. Wayne Dwyer</p>
    <p>Love is the immortal flow of energy that nourishes, extends and preserves. Its eternal goal is life. Smiley Blanton</p>

        <h1>Love Love Love</h1>
        <p>In love of home, the love of country has its rise. Charles Dickens</p>
        <p>For what is love itself, for the one we love best?--an enfolding<br>
           of immeasurable cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love.<br><br>

           George Elliot</p>
        <p>I sought for Love<br>
           But Love ran away from me.<br>
           I sought my Soul<br>
           But my Soul I couldn't see.<br>
           Then I sought You,<br>
           And I found all three.</p>
