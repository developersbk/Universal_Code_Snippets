        <p>Opposites attract, but after marriage, opposites attack.<br>
           Most of the time, we are attracted to people who don't have<br>
           the things that we have.<br>
           Incompatibility is why we get married,<br>
           but it's also used as a reason to divorce.<br>
           Incompatibility is just a lack of communication.<br>
           If we just try to love [our spouse] the way we want to be loved,<br>
           we are in trouble.<br>
           Unless you communicate,<br>
           it's difficult to know how to love another person.<br><br>
