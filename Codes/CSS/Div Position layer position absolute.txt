<h1>Love Sayings</h1>
<p>When love is in excess it brings a man no honor nor worthiness. Euripides </p>
<p>In pious times, ere priestcraft did begin, before polygamy was made a sin. John Dryden </p>

<div class="layer2">
<p>Love is not enough. It must be the foundation, the cornerstone - but not the complete structure. It is much too pliable, too yielding. Bette Davis </p>
<p>The last time I was inside a woman was when I went to the Statue of Liberty. Woody Allen </p>
