The thing about falling in love, is that if you do it right, you never have to hit the ground. Kendall Lepitzki 
<br><br>

They float around my blushing soul, those creatures gay and free,<br>
The butterflies that beat their dusty wings inside of me,<br>
My eyes are wide, my legs are numb, though nothing can deter,<br>
The paralyzing moment when my heart begins to stir,<br>
A rosy hue creeps up my flesh, a painful blissful haze,<br>
I'm soaring with delight and awe, yet spellbound by his gaze,<br>
At night we dance, aglow with joy, his smile a lasting shine,<br>
He claims my heart with ease and grace, it's his, no longer mine.<br><br>
