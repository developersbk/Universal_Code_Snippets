<h3>Aerogenerators</h3>
<p>A wind turbine is the popular name for a device
that converts kinetic energy from the wind into
electrical power. Technically there is no turbine
used in the design but the term appears to have
migrated from parallel hydroelectric technology.
The correct description for this type of machine
would be aerofoil-powered generator. A wind turbine
used for charging batteries may be referred to as a
wind charger.</p>
<p>The result of over a millennium of windmill
development and modern engineering, today's wind
turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical
and horizontal axis types. The smallest turbines are
used for applications such as battery charging for
auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power
traffic warning signs. Slightly larger turbines can
be used for making contributions to a domestic power
supply while selling unused power back to the utility
supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large
turbines, known as wind farms, are becoming an
increasingly important source of renewable energy and
are used by many countries as part of a strategy to
reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
