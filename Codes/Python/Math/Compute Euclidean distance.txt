In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" (i.e. straight-line) distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space. The associated norm is called the Euclidean norm.

x = (5, 6, 7)  
y = (8, 9, 9)  
distance = math.sqrt(sum([(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(x, y)]))
