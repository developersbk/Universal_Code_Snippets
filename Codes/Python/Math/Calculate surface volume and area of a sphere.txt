Python : Surface volume and area of a sphere
A sphere is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a completely round ball.
In three dimensions, the volume inside a sphere is derived to be V = 4/3*Ï€*r3 where r is the radius of the sphere


pi=22/7  
radian = float(input('Radius of sphere: '))  
sur_area = 4 * pi * radian **2  
volume = (4/3) * (pi * radian ** 3)  
print("Surface Area is: ", sur_area)  
print("Volume is: ", volume)
