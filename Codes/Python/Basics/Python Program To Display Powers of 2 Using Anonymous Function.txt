# Python Program to display the powers of 2 using anonymous function

# Change this value for a different result
terms = 10

# Uncomment to take number of terms from user
#terms = int(input("How many terms? "))

# use anonymous function
result = list(map(lambda x: 2 ** x, range(terms)))

# display the result

print("The total terms is:",terms)
for i in range(terms):
   print("2 raised to power",i,"is",result[i])

   Output:
   The total terms is: 10
2 raised to power 0 is 1
2 raised to power 1 is 2
2 raised to power 2 is 4
2 raised to power 3 is 8
2 raised to power 4 is 16
2 raised to power 5 is 32
2 raised to power 6 is 64
2 raised to power 7 is 128
2 raised to power 8 is 256
2 raised to power 9 is 512
