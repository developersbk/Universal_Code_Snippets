#Input that you read from STDIN includes everything the user typed, including the newline character at the end. 
#To get rid of that newline, you can use the chop or chomp functions. 

chop VARIABLE
chop LIST
chop

This function chops off the last character of a string and returns the character chopped. 
If VARIABLE is omitted, chop chops the default variable $_. 
For example, look at this script:

while (<>) {
    print;
}

You chop the input.

while (<>) {
    chop;
    print;
}
