#The chop function removes the last character of each word in an array. 
#The chop function returns value is the character it chopped. 
#The chomp function was introduced in Perl 5 to remove the last character in a scalar variable and the last character of each word in an array only if that character is the newline.

#Using chomp protects you from inadvertently removing some character other than the newline.


print "What is your name? ";
$name = <STDIN>;
print "$name.\n";
chop($name);   # Removes the last character.
print "$name.\n\n";
chop($name);
print "$name has been chopped a little too much.\n";
print "What is your age?  ";
chomp($age=<STDIN>); # Removes the last character if it is the newline.
chomp($age);         
print "$age!\n";
