There is no "class" keyword. 
The properties are variables used to describe the object. 
Methods are functions that create and manipulate the object. 
Objects are created with the bless function.

#Creating a Class

package Pet

sub new{ # Constructor
    my $class = shift;
    my $pet = {
        "Name"  => undef,
        "Owner" => undef,
        "Type"  => undef,
    };
    bless($pet, $class);
    sub set_pet{    
        my $self = shift;
        my ($name, $owner, $type)= @_;
        $self->{'Name'} = $name;
        $self->{'Owner'}= $owner;
        $self->{'Type'}= $type;
    }
    sub get_pet{
    my $self = shift;
    while(($key,$value)=each($%self)){
        print "$key: $value\n";
    }
}

#Instantiating a Class

$cat = Pet->new(); 
# Create an object with a constructor method
$cat->set_pet("Sneaky", "Mr. Jones", "Siamese");
# Access the object with an instance
$cat->get_pet;
