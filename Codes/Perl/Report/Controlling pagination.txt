The $= variable holds the number of lines allowed on a page. 
When the line number exceeds this amount, write outputs a new page.
$= defaults to 60. 
The $- variable counts down as each line gets output on a page. 
When $- gets to 0, write outputs a new page. 
You can set $- to 0 to force a page output on the next call to write. 
Setting $- works only if you have a top-of-page format, e.g., FILEHANDLE_TOP. 


          
The following table lists the variables relating to pages and formats.
