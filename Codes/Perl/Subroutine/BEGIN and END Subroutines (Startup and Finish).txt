#A BEGIN subroutine is executed immediately, before the rest of the file is even parsed. 
#If you have multiple BEGINs, they will be executed in the order they were defined.
#The END subroutine is executed when all is done. 
#Multiple END blocks are executed in reverse order.
#The keyword sub is not necessary when using these special subroutines.
