#To set up a reference, you use a backslash (\) character before the name of what you're referring to.
#$reference = \$referred_to;
#The reference is a scalar variable. 
#To access the value of the data referred to:
#$new_var = ${ $reference };
#You can also use a shorthand syntax like the following: 
#$new_var = $$reference;

# Reference to a scalar variable.
$var = "Hello";
