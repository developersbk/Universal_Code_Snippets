GetAttributes provides a scalar numeric value with special flags for the attributes. 

The basic syntax is 

use Win32::File;

Win32::File::GetAttributes($name, $attr);
The GetAttributes function returns false (0) on failure and true (non-zero value) on success. 
The GetAttributes function does not set the $! variable on the error. 
The $attr variable gets filled with a number of bit flags indicating the various attributes.
