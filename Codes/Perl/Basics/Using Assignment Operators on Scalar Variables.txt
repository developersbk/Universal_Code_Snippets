#How do you place data in a scalar variable? 
#You use the assignment operator.

$variable1 = 5;

#String assignments work much the same way:

$variable1 = "Hello there!";

#Besides single assignments, you can create multiple assignments in the same statement like this:

$x = $y = $z = 1;
print join (", ", $x, $y, $z);
