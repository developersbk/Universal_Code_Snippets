OPERATOR            PURPOSE

+                   Computes the additive value of the two operands.

                   Computes the difference between the two operands.

*                   Computes the multiplication of the two operands.

/                   Computes the division between the two operands.

%                   Computes the modulus (remainder) of the two operands.

==                  Returns True if the two operands are equal, False otherwise.

!=                  Returns True if the two operands are not equal, False otherwise.

>=                  Greater than.

<=                  Less than.

>                   

<=>                 Returns -1 if the left operand is less than the right, +1 if is it greater than, and 0 (False) otherwise.

&&                  a logical AND operation. 

||                  a logical OR operation. 

&                   Returns the value of the two operators bitwise ANDed.

|                   Returns the value of the two operators bitwise ORed.

~                   Returns the value of the two operators bitwise XORed.

++                  Increment operator. Increments the variable's value by 1.

--                  Decrement operator. Decrements the variable's value by 1.

xx                  Computes the power of the left value to the power of the right value.

+=                  Adds the value of the right operand to the value of the left operand.

-=                  Subtracts the value of the right operand from the value of the left operand.

x=                  Multiplies the value of the left operand with the value of the right operand.

>>                  Shifts the left operand right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

<<                  Shifts the left operand left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

~                   Performs a 1s complement of the operator. This is a unary operator.
